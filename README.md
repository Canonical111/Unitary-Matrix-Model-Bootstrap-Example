# One Matrix Unitary Bootstrap Example

## Introduction
This repository contains an example written in Mathematica for performing a unitary bootstrap on a one-matrix model. This code is primarily for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the basic concepts and techniques of matrix bootstrapping.

## Purpose
The code in this repository is meant to serve as a pedagogical tool. It is not optimized for performance, and there might be more efficient ways to achieve the same results using other methods or libraries.

## Usage
To use the example, simply clone this repository and open the `.nb` file in Mathematica. Ensure you have the necessary Mathematica version installed that supports all functions used in the code.

## Contributing
Feedback and contributions to this project are highly welcomed. If you have suggestions on how to improve the code or the educational aspects of this example, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
